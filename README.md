# James Dewes M269-EMA
This is the build component of my 2019 Open University end of module assignment for web technologies. Built without using frameworks this is the implementation of part of a series of wireframes for a back-end system designed to manage the administration of a university society. The first part of this question asked for the site to be built for a laptop sized screen while the second part asked for it to be adapted to suit mobile as well.

There were several other parts to the EMA including a project plan, wireframes and various design decision discussions.
